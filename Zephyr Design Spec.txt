Overview
	Purpose
		This document specifies the requirements for ‘Zephyr’, an HTML5 game being developed by Blackmodule Studio.

	Title and Genre
		‘Zephyr’ is Blackmodule Studio’s sci-fi space shoot 'em up.

	Game Concept
		'Zephyr' is a classic shoot em up blended with RPG/adventure concepts. The game will partially take place in an 'overworld map' which will be of the galaxy the game takes place in. While travelling in this galaxy view, the player can explore; finding hidden locations and anomalies, shopping for upgrades at space stations, or even receiving new missions from NPCs. These missions are where all of the fighting in the game takes place. The missions will be a 'Bullet Hell' style setting in vertical scrolling levels. The player can control the movement of the character, and use of special weapons and/or abilities. The player has  auto-turret weapons that are set to auto-fire. While in this mode, the player will generally be attempting to avoid enemy fire, as well as destroy enemy ships. When an enemy ship is destroyed, it will generally drop money, though it may occasionally drop a powerup or other loot. Depending on the mission at hand, the player will have specific objectives to accomplish, and depending on the result determines if they successessfully accomplish their mission.

	Storyline
		In the year 3045 the drone wars have left the Terran fleet scattered across the known galaxy. Earth was lost to the drones, and the human race was nearly wiped out. Now, rebuilding has begun, but there are new dangers out in deep space. There isn't much left of the fleet, but they must defend what's left, or all will be lost.

	Key objective
		Defeat alien commander. Perform missions to level up and upgrade you ship. Explore space, finding new technologies to aid in defending the Terran fleet.

	Game World
		The game world consists of an 'overworld' screen representing the current sector of the galaxy you are in. There are also 'mission' scenes in which the majority of gameplay will take place.

	Game Features
		The game will feature a hybrid of Bullet Hell style gameplay with classic RPG action. A fast paced shooter during missions, while allowing progression through upgrades to the ship, as well as new abilities learned through leveling up.

Gameplay
	Primary gameplay will be in the mission scenes in which a 'Bullet-Hell' style of gameplay will occur. Fast paced shooting to destroy enemies, and quick movement to avoid the barrage of enemy fire. As the player completes missions, they will receive experience as well as currency. Currency will be used in space stations and other such destinations in order to upgrade the players ship. Experience is used to unlock abilities of the player, these will be things such as movement techniques, and special abilities. Experience will also be used to unlock higher tier equipment as it is reflective of the players general reputation.

	In the overworld scenes, the player will not be combatting enemies, but will be exploring, travelling the sector of space, finding hidden locations, gearing up at space stations, and accepting new missions to earn their keep.

User Interface
	The user interface will primarily be menu-based
	HUD will display basic information, such as hull points, and shield, but will be minimalistic
